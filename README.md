# 🎓 Graduate Admission Chances Predictor

This project predicts the likelihood of a candidate being admitted to a graduate program based on their academic profile. Using machine learning models built in Python, the system estimates admission chances using features like GRE scores, CGPA, research experience, and more.

## 🔍 Project Highlights

- Predicts admission chances based on candidate profile  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for pattern recognition  
- Feature selection and preprocessing  
- Regression model using **TensorFlow/Keras (ANN)**  
- Model evaluation using RMSE and R² Score  
- Interactive visualizations using Matplotlib & Seaborn

## 📊 Input Features

- GRE Score  
- TOEFL Score  
- University Rating  
- Statement of Purpose (SOP)  
- Letter of Recommendation (LOR)  
- Undergraduate GPA (CGPA)  
- Research Experience (0 or 1)

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- Python  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
